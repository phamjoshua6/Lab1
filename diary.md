I woke up just like any normal day, snoozing my alarm clock until I get the feeling I have snoozed it too often. Then I eat my brunch along with my splendid and soothing cup of coffee. My day consisted of going to the library, reflecting on life, then heading to my classes before finding something that would cure my boredom. Luckily I had a great tennis session with some great people that made up for my quite boring day.
